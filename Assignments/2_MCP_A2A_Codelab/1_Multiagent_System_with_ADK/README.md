# Codelab 1: Multi-Agent System with ADK and A2A Protocol

## Overview

This codelab teaches you to build a multi-agent system using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), deploy it to Google Cloud's Agent Engine, and implement the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol for inter-agent communication.

You'll create an image scoring system where multiple specialized agents work together in a hierarchical structure. This demonstrates how to build modular, scalable applications by composing multiple agents that can delegate tasks to each other.

## What You'll Learn

- Build multi-agent systems with hierarchical agent structures
- Use Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) for agent development
- Deploy agents to Vertex AI Agent Engine on Google Cloud Platform
- Implement A2A protocol for agent discovery and communication
- Create and publish Agent Cards that describe agent capabilities
- Work with Cloud Storage and other GCP services

## Key Concepts

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Multiple specialized agents working together to solve complex problems
- **Agent Cards**: Standardized metadata describing agent capabilities, published at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`
- **A2A Protocol**: Open standard enabling agents to discover and communicate with each other
- **Hierarchical Architecture**: Root agents delegating tasks to specialized sub-agents
